For the Object-Oriented Programming with C assignment, I developed a Hydroponic System model for tomato plants. This system allows users to monitor and manage critical parameters such as pH levels, temperature, humidity, and nutritional needs. The program ensures that the hydroponic system operates optimally by maintaining the appropriate conditions required for tomato growth.

Key features of the system include:

pH Monitoring: The system ensures that the pH level is kept between 5.5 and 6.5, which is the optimal range for tomatoes. Incorrect values are rejected, prompting the user to re-enter the correct values.
Light and Darkness Management: The system controls the light cycle, maintaining 16 to 18 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness for optimal plant growth.
Temperature and Humidity Regulation: The system regulates temperature and humidity, maintaining specific ranges for day and night conditions.
Nutrient Management: The system tracks and manages the levels of essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK).
The program is implemented in C using structured programming techniques, with inputs validated and stored in files for easy access and management.
